While attending the UCB Coding Bootcamp, I was often told that the concepts would &apos;click&apos; one day, but I didn't realize when that would be. I wasn't satisfied with my understanding of the underlying concepts of web development so I decided to take the Codecademy Computer Science Professional Path and work on a challenging [Full Stack Project](https://github.com/RotichD/ecommerce-storefront).

It was the combination of learning more about Relational Databases through PostgreSQL on Codecademy and working on a Full Stack E-Commerce Project that greatly improved my understanding of these concepts.
